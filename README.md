## Show your work

1.  Create a Public repository ( please dont make a pull request, clone the private repository and create a new plublic one on your profile)
2.  Commit each step of your process so we can follow your thought process.

## What to build
The following is a list of items (prioritized from most important to least important) we wish to see:
* Design and implement  a documented RESTful API for the game (think of a mobile app for your API)
* Implement an API client library for the API designed above. Ideally, in a different language, of your preference, to the one used for the API
* When a cell with no adjacent mines is revealed, all adjacent squares will be revealed (and repeat) DONE
* Ability to 'flag' a cell with a question mark or red flag DONE
* Detect when game is over DONE
* Persistence
* Time tracking DONE
* Ability to start a new game and preserve/resume the old ones DONE
* Ability to select the game parameters: number of rows, columns, and mines DONE
* Ability to support multiple users/accounts
 
## Deliverables we expect:
* URL where the game can be accessed and played (use any platform of your preference: heroku.com, aws.amazon.com, etc)
* Code in a public Github repo
* README file with the decisions taken and important notes
